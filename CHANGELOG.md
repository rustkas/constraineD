## 0.0.3

- Constraint Satisfaction Problem Solver for Dart that uses a basic backtracking algorithm. It has no external dependencies and currently works. It is quite slow due to unimplemented optimizations like MAC3 and LCV. It does however support the MRV optimization.

## 0.0.4

- Add Darrt 2 support.
